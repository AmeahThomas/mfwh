    <p>CSS is used to style HTML elements on a web page. It allows you to change the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of your website. By using CSS, you can create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages that enhance the user experience.</p>
    <p>With CSS, you can control the design of multiple web pages at once, making it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across your entire website. You can also use CSS to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that your website looks great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
    <p>Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web developers and designers, as it enables them to create beautiful and functional <em style="color: chocolate;">websites</em> that engage and delight users.</p>

    <p><h2 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">SYNTAX</h2></p>
    <p>CSS syntax consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector specifies which HTML elements the styles will be applied to, while the declaration block contains one or more declarations that define the styles to be applied.</p>
    <p>A declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon. The property specifies the aspect of the element that you want to style (such as color, font-size, or margin), while the value defines the specific style to be applied (such as red, 16px, or 10px).</p>
    <p>Here is an example of CSS syntax:</p>
    <pre>
       <i style="color:brown;"> p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }</i>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the selector is "p", which targets all paragraph elements on the web page. The declaration block contains two declarations: "color: blue;" and "font-size: 16px;". This means that all paragraph elements will have blue text and a font size of 16 pixels.</p>

    <h2>CSS SELECTOR</h2>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements on a web page and apply styles to them. There are several types of CSS selectors, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Element selectors: target specific HTML elements, such as p, h1, or div.</li>
        <li>Class selectors: target elements with a specific class attribute, using a period (.) followed by the class name.</li>
        <li>ID selectors: target elements with a specific ID attribute, using a hash (#) followed by the ID name.</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors: target elements based on their attributes, such as [type="text"] to target input elements of type text.</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selectors: target elements based on their state or position, such as :hover to apply styles when an element is hovered over.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using CSS selectors, you can apply styles to specific elements on your web
    page, allowing you to create a customized and visually appealing design.</p>.

    <h3>CSS Elements Selector</h3>
    <p>Element selectors are used to target specific HTML elements on a web page. By using element selectors, you can apply styles to all instances of a particular element type. For example, if you want to change the color of all paragraph elements on your web page, you can use the following CSS code:</p>
    <pre>
        p {
            color: green;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the selector is "p", which targets all paragraph elements
    on the web page. The declaration block contains one declaration: "color: green;". This means that all paragraph elements will have green text.</p>

    <h3>How to Add CSS</h3>
    <p>There are three ways to add CSS to an HTML document: inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline styles: You can add CSS directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute. For example: <code>&lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;This is a red paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Internal stylesheets: You can include CSS within the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; tag. For example:
            <pre>
                &lt;style&gt;
                    p {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                &lt;/style&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>External stylesheets: You can create a separate CSS file and link to it from your HTML document using the &lt;link&gt; tag. For example:
            <pre>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using external stylesheets is the most efficient way to manage CSS for larger websites
    because it allows you to keep your CSS separate from your HTML and apply the same styles across multiple pages.</p>
